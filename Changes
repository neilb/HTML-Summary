Revision history for Perl module HTML::Summary

0.022 2016-07-03 NEILB
    - Was explicitly setting $VERSION in all modules, instead of letting
      Dist::Zilla do it for me. Thanks to MANWAR for pointing this out.

0.021 2015-10-25 NEILB
    - Switched to Dist::Zilla, prompted by a PR to add a LICENSE file --
      better to have DZ handle that for me. Thanks to MANWAR for the nudge.

    - Changed URL repos to reflect my changed github username
    - Got rid of use of indirect method notation from doc
    - Fixed USE_META - was producing a warning if there wasn't
      a <meta name=description> but there was a different meta tag.
      Added test t/02-use-meta.t. Thanks to Paul Ryan for RT#92320

0.019 2014-01-19
    - Added github repo to metadata (via Makefile.PL) and to pods
    - Dropped Lingua::JA::Jcode, and now use the Jcode module from CPAN

      If you were using Lingua::JA::Jcode, just switch to using Jcode.
